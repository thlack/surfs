# thlack.blocks

FIXME: my new library.

## Usage

FIXME: write usage documentation!

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -A:test:runner -M:runner

Build a deployable jar of this library:

    $ clojure -A:jar -M:jar

Install it locally:

    $ clojure -A:install -M:install

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment variables:

    $ clojure -A:deploy -M:deploy
